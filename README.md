## Vue Carousel

This is a simple carousel built using Vue.js.

It auto starts and has navigation for next and previous slide. It takes up the full screen. 

There are no external node_modules to install for this example. Just open the file in your 
browser and it works. 

### Road Map

- Add dots to let the user know what slide they are on
- Make the slides take up the container instead of the whole window, so if the container 
is smaller than the window the slides will size properly
- Add navigation to a specific slide
- Add prop for setting slide speed and auto play timer
